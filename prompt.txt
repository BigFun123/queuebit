This is an NPM package that uses javascript.
Do not use typescript.
It is a socket server API for using a queue.
It uses a socket to add messages to the queue and guarantees delivery to any listeners. 
Messages are always JSON objects, they can have an expiry datetime parameter, 
or be set to be removed from the queue after the first read.
The queue should be compatible with NATS queue.
